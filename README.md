## Codebase structure

- [`agent.py`](./agent.py): Factorised active inference agent
- [`games.py`](./games.py): Normal-form game payoff matrices
- [`utils/`](./utils/): Utility modules
    - `simulation.py`: Simulation functions, to run experiments using the agents and games
    - `database.py`: Database utilities, to store and retrieve simulation results
    - `timeseries.py`: Time series utilities, to get metrics and apply transforms to time series data
    - `plotting.py`: Plotting functions, to plot the results of the simulations
    - `analysis.py`: Functions for information-theoretic analysis
- [`scripts/`](./scripts/): Command-line scripts to run simulations and plot results
    - `INFG-simulate.py`: Run multiple simulations and store the results in a database
    - `INFG-plot.py`: Plot the results of multiple simulations
- [`notebooks/`](./notebooks/): Jupyter notebooks and supporting code
- [`docs/`](./docs/): Documentation and figures

## Scripts

```bash
# 1. Set simulation (expriment) configuration
# [for now, we edit `scripts/INFG-simulate.py` to change the simulation parameters]

# 2. Run simulations
nohup python -OO INFG-simulate.py --num-repeats=20 --db-path=my-experiments.db &

# 3. Plot all results
python INFG-plot-batch.py --db-path=my-experiments.db --timestamp=20240928
```
